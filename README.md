# ODST Soundtracks
This mod **plays ODST soundtracks** so you can enjoy the classic ODST vibe while playing, it also makes a nice effect and atmosphere. All credits go to Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori for making the soundtracks.

_(Note that i will also maybe make a mod that plays Halo 3 soundtracks such as "the Storm", who knows?)_
